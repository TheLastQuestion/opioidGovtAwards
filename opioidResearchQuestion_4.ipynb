       "'Pain management is critical throughout cancer care, from diagnosis through treatment and survivorship, and inadvanced illness and at the end of life. Improving cancer pain management is critical over the next decade,given (1) more number of cancer survivors with long-term consequences of cancer and its treatment, (2) longersurvival with advanced cancer, with more time with and complexity of pain, and (3) growing evidence thatchronic opioids are often ineffective and have many adverse effects and risks. Cancer pain is oftenchallenging; it interacts with many issues, including psychological and social concerns and other symptoms,especially fatigue and sleep disturbances. Severe cancer pain is still frequent in the United States; the qualityof pain management is often suboptimal; key effective nonpharmacologic strategies, such as rehabilitation, andpsychosocial approaches, such as patient education and support, are underused; and disparities inmanagement persist. A key solution, using a biopsychosocial approach, considers not only biological aspects,but other related symptoms and interactions with psychological (e.g., distress, mood) and social (e.g., culture,family, financial stressors) factors. The effectiveness of biopsychosocial approaches is well-established, butimproving use in cancer care requires both interdisciplinary health professional education and qualityimprovement approaches. This education program is based on the extensive health professional educationprograms at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Medicine and supportive oncologyeducation programs of the City of Hope. The overall goal is to improve US capacity for biopsychosocial cancerpain management. To accomplish this, we will train 360 cancer care professionals (physicians, nurses, socialworkers and others) over the award. In a 15-week program, participants will participate in 8 webinars, an onlinesimulation program, a 2-day intensive skills-based workshop, and 2 pre-workshop preparatory and 4 post-workshop implementation faculty-participant conference calls. The aims are to (1) implement a curriculumfor training healthcare professionals in principles of biopsychosocial cancer pain management andquality improvement, (2) sustain and refine newly acquired pain management and quality improvementskills through ongoing support and building a networking community, and (3) assess the effectivenessof the education after the program and sustainability at one year.An expert team of faculty, advisors andpatient advocates will plan, produce, and evaluate the program, including experts in professional and executiveeducation, pain management and associated issues and symptoms, skills-based supportive oncologyeducation and quality of care. The Principal Investigators have combined decades of experience in educatinghealth professionals in biopsychosocial pain management and program development. We have support fromlocal and national cancer networks and organizations to recruit a diverse, qualified participant pool and supportimplementation into practice, with the goal of improving patient care and outcomes.'"

      "Project SummaryBackground: The gate theory of pain predicts that inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn act as “gatecontrol” elements to mediate interaction between innocuous and noxious stimuli. It has been postulated thatrelease of this inhibitory gate allows innocuous mechanical stimuli to access the nociceptive pathway resultingin tactile allodynia following nerve injury. Increasing evidence demonstrates an excitatory pathway involvingPKCγ-expressing interneurons that is held silent under nonpathological conditions via a strong feedforwardinhibitory gate by local interneurons. Failure of the inhibitory control on PKCγ-expressing interneurons isbelieved to underly tactile alloynia. In the neuropathic pain state failure of the inhibitory gate is due to a BDNF-dependent reduction in inhibitory tone mediated by a change in chloride homeostasis resulting from alteredexpression of chloride cotransporters. Current data demonstrates that the precursor protein VGF (non-acronymic) is upregulated in the spinal cord following nerve injury, and preliminary data suggest that the VGF-derived neuropeptide TLQP-62 induces BDNF signaling in the spinal cord.Objective: We hypothesize that TLQP-62 contributes to tactile allodynia following nerve injury by mediating aBDNF-dependent central sensitization reliant on a reduction in inhibitory tone. The proposed studies willcharacterize this newly identified mediator of neuroplasticity and its contribution to the development ofneuropathic pain. The mechanistic understanding acquired will advance our search for new therapeuticinterventions and biomarkers for neuropathic pain.Specific aims: 1) Determine the function of TLQP-62 in inducing BDNF-dependent changes in chloridecotransporter expression after nerve injury, using biochemical approaches. 2) Determine the function of TLQP-62 in the development of reduced inhibitory tone following nerve injury, patch-clamp recording and calciumimaging in spinal cord slices. 3) Determine the function of TLQP-62 in opening of the feedforward inhibitorygate, using in vivo electrophysiology.\n"

We and other investigators are focusing onmechanisms that terminate hyperpermeability. Because many negative effects of hyper-permeability are due to its persistence beyond what is required for preserving organ function,we propose to elucidate mechanisms that terminate hyperpermeability and thereby restoremicrovascular barrier properties, while retaining its beneficial effects. Based on a) protein trafficmechanisms, b) our demonstration that eNOS translocation to cytosol is necessary for onset ofhyperpermeability, c) the demonstration that VASP (vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein) isfundamental for cell adhesion and endothelial barrier properties, and d) our preliminary data thatselective stimulation of Epac (exchange protein activated by cAMP) returns eNOS to the cellmembrane, we will test the central hypothesis that the signaling that leads to endothelialhyperpermeability initiates a delayed increase in [cAMP], which causes VASP-mediatedtranslocation of eNOS and Epac to the cell membrane leading to inactivation ofhyperpermeability. We will test this hypothesis through 4 Specific Aims; in each Aimmeasurement of permeability will be an end-point in vivo or in vitro: SA1. To determine whetherduring hyperpermeability the activity of cytoplasmic and not plasma membrane eNOS causesthe increase in cAMP required for inactivation of hyperpermeability. We will assess inactivationof hyperpermeability and measure [cAMP] as a function of [NO] in cells with eNOS expressedeither in the cytosol or in the cell membrane, and in primary endothelial cells (EC). SA2. Todetermine whether a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) mediates the increase in [cAMP]. Thisaim will study a plausible alternative mechanism to cytosolic [NO] as the cause for the increasein [cAMP]. SA3. To determine the role of VASP phosphorylation in contributing to eNOS andEpac translocation to cell membrane. In wild type and in VASP-KO endothelial cells and mice,we will test the cause-effect relation between VASP phosphorylation and inactivation ofhyperpermeability. We will stimulate eNOS translocation with 8-cPT-2-O-Me-cAMP, a selectiveactivator of Epac. SA4. To determine the signaling interactions between VASP phosphorylationand VASP S-nitrosation in the regulation of hyperpermeability. S-nitrosation is increasinglyrecognized as an important posttranslational regulatory modification in EC. Whether S-nitrosation promotes inactivation is unknown.

       "      <td>ABSTRACT Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia that can have devastating consequences, includingstroke and accelerated decline in cognitive function. Because AF is often asymptomatic and escapes clinicaldetection (subclinical AF), conventional methods for identifying AF have underestimated the populationburden of AF. African Americans have a lower risk of clinically-recognized AF than whites, yet they suffer morestroke and cognitive impairment. A high prevalence of subclinical AF and of another important arrhythmia,supraventricular ectopy (SVE), may help to explain this paradox. In addition, several emerging risk factorsfor AF and SVE, including long-term changes in blood pressure, hypokalemia, the use of certain medications,and psychosocial factors, are modifiable and represent potential targets for AF prevention. The use of sensitiveand unbiased methods to detect AF and SVE, and the discovery of novel modifiable risk factors for thesearrhythmias, may offer opportunities for improved cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention among AfricanAmericans. Our project will use a non-invasive electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring device that is both well-tolerated and sensitive for detecting subclinical arrhythmia to measure subclinical AF, AF type (paroxysmal vs.persistent), and SVE frequency. In this ancillary study, we propose to conduct 14-day continuous ECGmonitoring on 2,000 participants who return for Field Center Exam 4 of the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), a largeprospective cohort study of CVD risk factors in African Americans. We will also use data from anticipatedcontract funded components of the Field Center Exam, including cognitive assessments and brain magneticresonance imaging (MRI). Our goals are to assess the population burden of subclinical AF and SVE amongAfrican Americans, and to identify correlates of subclinical AF and SVE that may be modifiable risk factors orconsequences of these arrhythmias. There are four aims. Aim 1: Estimate the age- and sex-specificprevalence of subclinical AF and AF type (paroxysmal vs. persistent) among African Americans in the JHS,and compare with the prevalence of subclinical AF and AF type among white participants undergoing 14-daycontinuous ECG monitoring in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and the Atherosclerosis Risk inCommunities Study. Aim 2: Using data from JHS Exams 1-4, (a) evaluate whether traditional AF risk factorsare associated with subclinical AF and SVE, and (b) identify novel, modifiable risk factors for these arrhythmias.Aim 3: Evaluate the utility of a clinical AF risk score, NT-proBNP levels, and risk factors identified from Aim 2for the prediction of subclinical AF. Aim 4: In cross-sectional analyses, determine whether subclinical AF andSVE are associated with worse cognitive function and with brain MRI abnormalities. This project will generatenew knowledge about subclinical AF and SVE that will be relevant to patients, and that will inform preventionand treatment strategies to reduce the burden of AF and AF-related complications among African Americans.</td>\n",

      "Project SummaryBackground: The gate theory of pain predicts that inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn act as “gatecontrol” elements to mediate interaction between innocuous and noxious stimuli. It has been postulated thatrelease of this inhibitory gate allows innocuous mechanical stimuli to access the nociceptive pathway resultingin tactile allodynia following nerve injury. Increasing evidence demonstrates an excitatory pathway involvingPKCγ-expressing interneurons that is held silent under nonpathological conditions via a strong feedforwardinhibitory gate by local interneurons. Failure of the inhibitory control on PKCγ-expressing interneurons isbelieved to underly tactile alloynia. In the neuropathic pain state failure of the inhibitory gate is due to a BDNF-dependent reduction in inhibitory tone mediated by a change in chloride homeostasis resulting from alteredexpression of chloride cotransporters. Current data demonstrates that the precursor protein VGF (non-acronymic) is upregulated in the spinal cord following nerve injury, and preliminary data suggest that the VGF-derived neuropeptide TLQP-62 induces BDNF signaling in the spinal cord.Objective: We hypothesize that TLQP-62 contributes to tactile allodynia following nerve injury by mediating aBDNF-dependent central sensitization reliant on a reduction in inhibitory tone. The proposed studies willcharacterize this newly identified mediator of neuroplasticity and its contribution to the development ofneuropathic pain. The mechanistic understanding acquired will advance our search for new therapeuticinterventions and biomarkers for neuropathic pain.Specific aims: 1) Determine the function of TLQP-62 in inducing BDNF-dependent changes in chloridecotransporter expression after nerve injury, using biochemical approaches. 2) Determine the function of TLQP-62 in the development of reduced inhibitory tone following nerve injury, patch-clamp recording and calciumimaging in spinal cord slices. 3) Determine the function of TLQP-62 in opening of the feedforward inhibitorygate, using in vivo electrophysiology.\n"
